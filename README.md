# Time-series-AD-with-TCN
Temporal Convolutional Network in the time series anomaly detection task -
model implementation, experimental framework, experiment results.

### Dataset

For the purpose of testing the anomaly detection model, synthetic
_SinusRandomWalk_ (SRW) dataset has been used. It has been downloaded
from [this site](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/norma/).
